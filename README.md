WEB PLOTTER
===========

It's a simple webapp that let's you write a program and plot a graphic.
Instead of just write the mathematical function like "x^2 + 1" that you would type in Geogebra writing a program lets you plot much more complex graphics.
The plots are made in client side,and can be written in Coffeescript or Javascript, your choice.
It can handle animations too. I also added a button to let you save the graphic as a image.
